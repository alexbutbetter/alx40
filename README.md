# alx40

40% plank (i dont know which yet) mounted keyboard made in Fusion 360

This board should be 3D printed so the plate will be well... plastic so is the case but some foam will do the trick. So far designed to work with the BM40 hotswap PCB.
If anyone wants to make changes to the design, I will post the project files in the repo, doubt anyone would want to since this keyboard is already going to be awful.
